$ontext
A two-stage generation expansion planning problem (GEP) with one producer attempting to satisfy a known demand at one node using two technologies while minimzing the cost of providing electricity service. Each technology alternative has a fixed and marginal cost, which needs to be balanced in order to select the optimal production mix. As expected low marginal cost technologies tend to have higher fixed costs. In this early model version, we implement the formulation as a one period optimization problem.
