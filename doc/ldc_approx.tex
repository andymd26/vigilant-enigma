\section{Introduction}
In this paper we discuss the methods used to best approximate the load duration curve.
\section{Methods}
\subsection{Regression Trees}
We can approach the problem of approximating the load duration curve by ways of a step function as a classification problem, whereby we want to minimize the distance between points in the same group but maximize the difference between groups.
