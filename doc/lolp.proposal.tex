\begin{document}
The load duration curve is constructed from hourly system production data, which is arranged in descending order of magnitude. 
The units are MW on the y-axis and hours on the x-axis. 
From the curve we can estimate the amount of time that demand was above various thresholds. 
Do they estimate a load duration curve and then 

The loss of load expectation (LOLE) is defined as the number of poeiods in which demand exceeds the available capacity.
